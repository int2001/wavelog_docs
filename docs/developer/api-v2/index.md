# API v2

!!! warning "Wavelog Version 3.1.0 or later required"
    API v2 is only available in Wavelog 3.1.0 and later. If your instance runs an
    earlier version, please upgrade first.

Wavelog's **REST API v2** is a modern, resource-oriented HTTP API for third-party
tools — radios, external loggers, monitoring systems and your own scripts. It runs
side by side with the [legacy v1 API](../api.md): v2 does not replace v1, and both
can be used at the same time.

!!! note
    API v2 requires a dedicated **v2 token** (prefixed `wl2_`). Legacy v1 API keys
    are **not** accepted on any `/api/v2/…` endpoint.

## What's different from v1

| Aspect | v1 (`/api/…`) | v2 (`/api/v2/…`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URL style | RPC — the operation is the method name (`/api/qso`) | REST — a resource path plus an HTTP verb (`POST /api/v2/qso`) |
| HTTP verbs | mostly `POST` | `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` |
| Authentication | key inside the JSON body / URL | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header |
| Token format | `wl…` | `wl2_…` |
| Token storage | plaintext in the database | only a SHA-256 **hash** is stored |
| Permissions | a single `r` / `rw` right | granular per-resource scopes (`qso:read`, `qso:write`, …) |
| Response | varies per endpoint | consistent envelope, HTTP status carries the meaning |

## Base URL

Every endpoint lives under the `api/v2` prefix:

```text
https://<your-wavelog-host>/index.php/api/v2/<resource>[/<id>]
```

- `<resource>` is a singular, lowercase name (`qso`, `station`, `radio`, `statistic`,
  `lookup`, `club`, `token`).
- `<id>` is the numeric primary key of a single item, where applicable.

That is the **complete** URL space: a path with more than those two segments is
not a URL that exists and returns `404 not_found`, rather than being answered by
ignoring the surplus. A trailing slash is fine.

```text
/api/v2/qso          ✅ list
/api/v2/qso/42       ✅ single item
/api/v2/qso/         ✅ same as /api/v2/qso
/api/v2/qso/42/notes ❌ 404 not_found
```

Depending on your webserver configuration you may be able to omit the `index.php/`
segment. All examples in this documentation include it for maximum compatibility.

## Available resources

| Resource | Path | Scope | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [QSO](qso.md) | `/api/v2/qso` | `qso:*` | Read, create, update and delete log contacts; ADIF import/export |
| [Station](station.md) | `/api/v2/station` | `station:*` | Manage station locations (logbook profiles) |
| [Radio](radio.md) | `/api/v2/radio` | `radio:*` | Push and read live CAT radio state |
| [Statistic](statistic.md) | `/api/v2/statistic` | `statistic:read` | Read-only counters for dashboards & monitoring |
| [Lookup](lookup.md) | `/api/v2/lookup` | `lookup:read` | Look up a callsign (DXCC + worked/confirmed) or a gridsquare |
| [Club](club.md) | `/api/v2/club` | `club:read` | List a clubstation's members (officers only) |
| [Token](token.md) | `/api/v2/token` | — | Metadata about the current token (whoami) |

## Authentication

### Creating a token

1. Log in to Wavelog and open the **API** section from the user menu.
2. Create a new **API v2 token**. You choose:
    - a **name** (to recognise the token later),
    - one or more **scopes** (see [Scopes](#scopes)),
    - an **expiry**: 30, 90 or 365 days, or *never*.
3. The full token (`wl2_…`) is shown **exactly once**, right after creation. Copy
   it immediately — Wavelog only stores a hash and can never show it again.

You can revoke a token at any time from the same screen; revocation is immediate.

!!! warning
    Treat a token like a password. Anyone holding it can act on your data within
    the granted scopes. If a token leaks, revoke it and create a new one.

### Sending the token

Send the token in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme:

```http
Authorization: Bearer wl2_your_token_here
```

As a fallback, an `X-API-Key` header is also accepted:

```http
X-API-Key: wl2_your_token_here
```

!!! note
    The API is **sessionless**. It never uses your browser login — all access and
    ownership is derived from the token's owner. A token can only ever see and
    modify data belonging to the user it was created for.

    A token created while switched into a clubstation is owned by the *club*,
    and what it may do additionally depends on the creator's permission level
    there. See [Clubstations](clubstation.md).

### Scopes

Permissions are **granular** and follow the pattern `<resource>:<action>`:

| Action | Granted for | Required by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | reading data | `GET` requests |
| `write` | creating and updating data | `POST`, `PATCH` requests |
| `delete` | deleting data | `DELETE` requests |

Scopes are independent, so you can mint a read-only token, a write-only token, or
any combination. A request whose verb needs a scope the token does not carry is
rejected with `403 insufficient_scope`.

The full set of scopes offered when creating a token is:

| Scope | Allows |
| --- | --- |
| `qso:read` / `qso:write` / `qso:delete` | Read / create+update / delete QSOs |
| `station:read` / `station:write` / `station:delete` | Read / create+update / delete station locations |
| `radio:read` / `radio:write` / `radio:delete` | Read / create+update / delete radios |
| `statistic:read` | Read statistics |
| `lookup:read` | Look up callsigns and grids |
| `club:read` | Read club members |

The [Token](token.md) resource (whoami) needs no scope — any valid token may read
its own metadata.

Scopes are the *only* permission layer for a personal token. A
[clubstation](clubstation.md) token passes a second one on top: the member's
permission level on the club. Holding `station:write` does not help if the level
behind the token is below officer.

## Request and response conventions

### HTTP verbs

| Verb | Path | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/<resource>` | List items |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/<resource>/<id>` | Fetch a single item |
| `POST` | `/api/v2/<resource>` | Create an item |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v2/<resource>/<id>` | **Partial** update — only the fields you send are changed |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v2/<resource>/<id>` | Delete an item |

!!! note "The API has no `PUT`"
    Updates are always partial. Wavelog is the source of truth for your data, and
    a full replace would let a client blank fields it never knew existed — every
    field added in a future release would silently be wiped by older clients. To
    overwrite an item completely, send every field explicitly in a `PATCH`.

Not every resource implements every verb (for example, [Radio](radio.md) has no
`PATCH`, and [Statistic](statistic.md) is read-only). An unsupported verb
returns `405 method_not_allowed` together with an `Allow` header listing exactly
the verbs that resource does implement:

```http
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
```

The verb is checked **before** the scope, so a `POST` to a read-only resource is
a `405` and not a `403`: the scope it would need (`lookup:write`) does not exist
and no token can ever hold it, so reporting a missing scope would point at the
wrong problem.

### Request bodies

- Send write payloads as JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Body fields must be **scalar** values (string, number, boolean or `null`).
  Nested objects or arrays are rejected with `400 validation_error`.
- Malformed JSON returns `400 invalid_json`.

### Success responses

Successful responses use a slim envelope. The payload is always under `data`.
Every JSON success response also includes a `meta` block with common request
context:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | UTC response timestamp (ISO-8601, e.g. `2026-07-18T12:34:56+00:00`) |
| `resource` | API v2 resource segment (`qso`, `station`, `statistic`, ...; `meta` for `/api/v2` and `/api/v2/status`) |
| `method` | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) |

Resource-specific metadata (pagination, lookup detail, statistic profile, ...)
is added to the same `meta` object.

Examples:

```json
{
  "data": { "id": 42, "call": "N9EAT" },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2026-07-18T12:34:56+00:00",
    "resource": "qso",
    "method": "GET"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": [ { "id": 42 }, { "id": 43 } ],
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2026-07-18T12:34:56+00:00",
    "resource": "qso",
    "method": "GET",
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 50,
    "count": 2
  }
}
```

A successful `DELETE` returns **`204 No Content`** with an empty body.

### Error responses

Errors use an `error` envelope and a matching HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "insufficient_scope",
    "message": "Token is missing the required scope: qso:write",
    "details": { "required_scope": "qso:write" }
  }
}
```

| HTTP | `code` | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `validation_error` | Missing/invalid field, or a non-scalar value |
| 400 | `invalid_json` | The request body is not valid JSON |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | No token supplied |
| 401 | `invalid_token` | Unknown, revoked, or non-`wl2_` token (e.g. a legacy v1 key) |
| 401 | `token_expired` | The token's expiry date has passed |
| 403 | `insufficient_scope` | The token lacks the scope the verb requires |
| 403 | `forbidden` | The referenced item does not belong to the token owner |
| 403 | `insufficient_club_permission` | [Clubstation](clubstation.md) token whose permission level is too low (see `details.required_level`) |
| 403 | `club_access_revoked` | The [clubstation](clubstation.md) membership behind the token has been withdrawn |
| 404 | `not_found` | Unknown resource, path or item id — see the note below |
| 405 | `method_not_allowed` | Verb not supported by this resource (see `Allow` header) |
| 409 | `conflict` | Duplicate, or a state that forbids the action |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | [Rate limit](#rate-limiting) exceeded (see `details.retry_after`, in seconds) |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Unexpected server-side error |

!!! note "`404` also covers items you may not see"
    An item that exists but is out of reach for your token is reported as
    `404 not_found`, not `403`. Confirming that a row exists would already leak
    something about another user's data. This is why a
    [clubstation](clubstation.md) member gets a `404` for a QSO logged by a
    different operator.

### Pagination

List endpoints that can return many rows (currently [QSO](qso.md)) support
pagination through query parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | `1` | 1-based page number |
| `per_page` | `50` | Maximum `5000` (see the [QSO](qso.md#list-qsos) resource for per-format defaults) |

The pagination fields are part of `meta` and report the page state:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `page` | The page you requested |
| `per_page` | Items per page |
| `count` | Items on **this** page |
| `total` | Items across **all** pages for the current filter |
| `total_pages` | `ceil(total / per_page)` |
| `has_more` | `true` while `page < total_pages` |

```json
{
  "data": [ { "id": 42 } ],
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2026-07-18T12:34:56+00:00",
    "resource": "qso",
    "method": "GET",
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 50,
    "count": 50,
    "total": 237,
    "total_pages": 5,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

To iterate the full set, request pages until `has_more` is `false` (equivalently,
until `page` reaches `total_pages`). You never need to probe for an empty page.

### Rate limiting

Rate limiting is **opt-in**: it is inactive until the instance owner configures it,
and it uses a sliding window. When a limit is exceeded, the API returns
`429 rate_limited` with `details.retry_after` (seconds to wait). If no limit is
configured, no throttling is applied — but please still call the API only when you
actually have new data to send or fetch.

#### Buckets

Every v2 request passes through up to two independent counters:

| Bucket | Checked | Counted per | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api_v2_auth` | before authentication | client IP address | Slows down brute-force attempts against the token keyspace |
| `api_v2_<resource>` | after successful authentication | token | Normal usage limit, e.g. `api_v2_qso`, `api_v2_station` |

A client with a valid token passes through both. A client with an invalid token
never gets past the first — which is the point: a rejected token never reaches the
per-token bucket, so without `api_v2_auth` the token keyspace could be probed at
full speed.

`api_v2_auth` is deliberately **not** per resource. If it were, the limit could be
sidestepped by rotating the resource in the URL (`/qso`, `/station`, `/radio`, …).

#### Configuration

Limits live in `application/config/config.php` (Docker installations:
`application/config/docker/config.php`). Each entry sets a maximum number of
`requests` within a `window` in seconds:

```php
$config['api_rate_limits'] = [
    // API v2 — bucket names carry the "api_v2_" prefix
    'api_v2_auth'      => ['requests' => 10,  'window' => 120],
    'api_v2_qso'       => ['requests' => 120, 'window' => 60],
    'api_v2_lookup'    => ['requests' => 60,  'window' => 60],
    'api_v2_statistic' => ['requests' => 30,  'window' => 60],

    // v1 endpoints keep their bare method names
    'private_lookup'   => ['requests' => 60,  'window' => 60],

    // applies to every bucket not listed above
    'default'          => ['requests' => 60,  'window' => 60],
];
```

!!! warning "Without `default`, unlisted buckets are unlimited"
    Buckets are looked up by exact name, then fall back to `default`. If neither
    matches, **no limit is applied at all** to that bucket.

    This is easy to get wrong: an instance that configures only
    `'private_lookup'` has rate limiting switched on, yet every single v2
    endpoint — including `api_v2_auth` — remains unthrottled.

    Either set a `default`, or list `api_v2_auth` explicitly.

v1 and v2 share the same config array but never collide: v1 buckets are named
after the API method (`lookup`, `private_lookup`, `qso`), v2 buckets always carry
the `api_v2_` prefix. Both are configured independently.

To disable rate limiting entirely, set `$config['api_rate_limits'] = null;` or
leave it commented out.

### Withheld user data

Endpoints that describe **other people's accounts** disclose personal data, and
what an instance may hand out differs per country. The instance owner therefore
picks which of those fields to withhold:

```php
$config['apiv2_hide_userdata'] = ['user_email', 'user_locator'];
```

The listed fields are left **out of the response entirely** — they are not
blanked, not `null`, the key is simply absent. An empty array (the default)
discloses everything.

Currently this affects the [Club](club.md#the-member-object) resource, the only
one that returns another user's account data.

Fields which are always returned and **cannot** be withheld are:

```text
user_id
user_callsign
permission_level
```

Fields which can be withheld are:

```text
user_firstname
user_lastname
user_locator
user_name
user_email
user_language
```

!!! warning "For clients: treat the optional fields defensively"
    You cannot tell from the outside what an instance is configured to
    disclose, and there is no endpoint that reports it. Check that a field is
    present before you use it, and do not build a feature that only works when
    an instance happens to hand out email addresses.

### CORS

The API answers `OPTIONS` preflight requests with `204 No Content` and permits
cross-origin calls (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) for the `GET`, `POST`,
`PATCH`, `DELETE` and `OPTIONS` methods, allowing the `Authorization`,
`Content-Type` and `X-API-Key` headers.

### Status endpoint

`GET /api/v2` (and `GET /api/v2/status`) is **public** — no token required — and
is handy for a quick reachability check:

```bash
curl https://<WAVELOG_URL>/index.php/api/v2/status
```

```json
{
  "data": { "name": "Wavelog API", "status": "ok" },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2026-07-18T12:34:56+00:00",
    "resource": "status",
    "method": "GET"
  }
}
```

## Quickstart

List your station locations:

```bash
curl https://<WAVELOG_URL>/index.php/api/v2/station \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer wl2_your_token_here"
```

Create a QSO on station location `1`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<WAVELOG_URL>/index.php/api/v2/qso \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer wl2_your_token_here" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "station_profile_id": 1,
           "call": "N9EAT",
           "band": "20m",
           "mode": "SSB",
           "freq": 14075000,
           "qso_date": "2026-06-16",
           "time_on": "1706",
           "rst_sent": "59",
           "rst_rcvd": "57"
         }'
```

See the per-resource pages for the full field reference:
[QSO](qso.md) · [Station](station.md) · [Radio](radio.md) ·
[Statistic](statistic.md) · [Lookup](lookup.md) ·
[Club](club.md) · [Token](token.md).

If your token belongs to a clubstation rather than to your own account, read
[Clubstations](clubstation.md) as well — the permission level changes what
several of these resources return.
