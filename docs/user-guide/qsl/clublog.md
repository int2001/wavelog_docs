# Club Log

Wavelog uploads your QSOs to Club Log, either in batches or in real time, and imports the confirmations Club Log has for you.

The page lives at `User menu -> Third-Party Services -> Clublog Import / Export`.

!!! warning "Wavelog does not download your log"
    Only **confirmations** are fetched from Club Log. The QSO itself must already be in your Wavelog logbook — see the [overview](index.md).

## Credentials

Club Log credentials are stored **per user account**. Go to `User menu -> Edit profile -> Third Party Services` and fill in:

* **Club Log Email/Callsign**
* **Club Log Password**

!!! note
    If you have two-factor authentication enabled at Club Log, generate an **application password** there and use that instead of your normal password.

## Station location options

Two settings per station location (`Station Setup -> edit location`) control what happens with that location:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Ignore Clublog Upload** | When set to *Yes*, QSOs from this location are never uploaded |
| **ClubLog Realtime Upload** | When set to *Yes*, each QSO is pushed to Club Log immediately after logging |

The batch upload walks through every station location that is not ignored.

## Uploading

Open the export page and upload manually per station location, or let the `clublog_upload` job in the Cronmanager (`Admin -> Cron Jobs`) do it — by default every 6 hours.

Wavelog generates an ADIF file in the `uploads/` folder and sends it to Club Log, then marks the QSOs as submitted.

!!! note
    The web server needs write access to the `uploads/` folder.

## Importing confirmations

The same page offers a manual import per station location. It fetches the confirmations Club Log holds for your callsign and marks the matching QSOs in your log.

## Club Log SCP file

Independently of the log sync, Wavelog can use Club Log's **SCP file** (Super Check Partial) to suggest likely callsigns while you are logging.

The `update_update_clublog_scp` job in the Cronmanager keeps that file current and is **enabled by default**, running weekly. No Club Log account is needed for this.
